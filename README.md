Hello everyone!

I'm excited to share that I've developed a Spring Boot application connected to a MySQL database.

I put a lot of effort into establishing this connection, and it was an awesome experience working with the backend.

The prerequisites and project dependencies include:

1.Spring Web
2.JDBC API
3.MySQL Driver
4.Lombok

If you appreciate my work, please give it a like!
